                    After completing this TeamMate project, I gained more knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is new knowledge I have never learned. Still, after working with friends in the working group,
                     I have learned a lot from the expertise in new programming languages, how to organize folder layout, how to use GitHub, and how to report your work. In addition, I also received a lot of help 
                     from people on making reports and comments so that the finished product would have the best effect. This is also a product that I am very passionate about, and I also spend a lot of time 
                     revising, updating, and completing it. I hope this product will be well received by everyone and can share the bugs or parts people don't like so we can fix and improve. If successful, 
                     I also want to popularize this application widely in RMIT and other schools to help students have an effective and safe teamwork environment.

                    In this project, our group has worked so well together. Everyone takes their responsibility seriously, and is willing to support each other if there is any issue. Although we have a lot of meetings, 
                    we try to maintain a fun atmosphere. That helps our team to be more comfortable to share our thoughts and communicate more effectively. However, at the first period of time, we became too chilled, 
                    and it turned out that we wasted lots of time without any result. After that, to solve that problem, we always have an agenda for each meeting to ensure the progress and its quality.Moreover, 
                    I have learned many new things while working on this project. Since I am completely new to IT classes, I have so many challenges to adapt with the new things. My supportive teammates helped me 
                    a lot, e.g. explaining about technical phrases and sending useful online tutorials for me to study myself. Also, I have developed a general understanding about the technology industry in general 
                    and information systems in particular. Besides, one thing surprises me is that I never thought that I could study lots of interesting and completely new knowledge from a different major in just 
                    one semester. That motivates me to keep working hard to achieve my goals - becoming a software quality assurance in the future.

                    The performance of my team is adequate. Our teamwork and communication have been effective. We have already arranged a meeting to discuss ideas soon after the first week. We maintained close communication, 
                    and everyone was accountable for their assigned tasks.We all enjoy working together as a team. At the first few meetings, we lacked goals and results .What could be improved is the planning of our meetings; 
                    we meet quite frequently, but it is not always necessary to organize them. Each meeting would have been more meaningful if we had planned specific goals or criteria to achieve such as the meeting agenda.
                    I've learnt that in order to accomplish effective group work, you must build a strong connection with your group members; in this way, you will be better able to exchange ideas and distribute tasks. 
                    I've also learned that group work demands each member to be truthful about his or her ability to collaborate with other team members. This will allow us to assign tasks based on our respective abilities.
                    I believe that the most valuable skill I have acquired throughout this project is time management, followed by communication and collaborative abilities. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript to 
                    expand my web application development knowledge.

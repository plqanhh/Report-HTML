                    Even though there are many other methods for the software development life cycle, our team decided to use Scrum as our main way to work together. This is because we need an 
                    agile framework that is quick, flexible, and efficient. As a result, Scrum makes it easier to build and deliver products during our development phase

                    A key component of professional growth at universities might be regarded to be inter-professional abilities, notably teamwork in this study. 
                    It operates at the human level via cultural and knowledge aspects when it reaches the community level, which means that professional viewpoint 
                    may cause conflict and moral ambiguity about professional duties in project management [1]. In addition, challenges might arise from unease, 
                    ambiguous job assignment, diverse work cultures, and conflicting versions of information [2]. Therefore, it is advised that students actively
                     seek out teammates that meet their expectations when it comes to collaboration. This will ensure that the relationships between team members 
                     are positive, resulting in their willingness to assist, accept, and like one another [3].
                     <br>
                     Group assignments were prioritised in the majority of the courses offered ever since RMIT acknowledged the value of teamwork. In face-to-face 
                     classrooms, on Canvas, or via social media, RMIT students may discover teammates both online and offline. However, as there isn't yet a platform 
                     designed just for RMIT students, their messages may not reach the correct people, and it will take a lot of effort for them to connect and share 
                     information to make sure their potential teammates fit their expectations. After identifying the insights, our group created TinMate, a website 
                     that helps RMIT students discover teammates.

                    Since gen Z is using dating apps more and more, especially Tinder [4], which is the most popular app in the field, we decided to make the UI/UX of 
                    the TinMate website similar to Tinder to make it more user-friendly and familiar. The site will work like other dating apps, but in this prototype, 
                    the filter and its criteria will be changed to match the site's goal, which is to find teammates. For example, the GPA, the goal and strengths of the team, 
                    etc., will be used as filters. Also, familiar features of dating apps like viewing profiles, UI chat boxes, matching, SuperLike, and reporting will stay the same.
                     Also, since this site is only for RMIT students, you will need to show a screenshot of your student ID card when you sign in.
                    <br>
                    After that, we realised that, even though there are a lot of international and exchange students at RMIT, most of the posts about finding teammates on social 
                    media are in Vietnamese. This makes it hard for international students to understand and respond to the posts, and it's also a shame for local students because 
                    they might miss the chance to meet the right teammates. So, (name of website) will only use English to make sure everything works together.
                    <br>
                    It is hoped that the TinMate website will not only fix the problems with the old ways, but also give tech-savvy RMIT students a new, fun, and easy way to find 
                    teammates by using the same UI/UX as dating apps. Taking everything into account, our team thinks that this site can help RMIT students save time and effort while
                     still being able to work with the people they were supposed to work with.

                With limited for 4 weeks, we have managed to develop a playable Ping Pong as what we desired from the beginning, each bounce the player receive one point, we manage to put on sound as well as cool point feature, and a game over screen. Moreover, we manage to manipulate HTML, CSS and JS for showing our contents for the report on our website as well as the game. The biggest problem right now is time, and we are too new with web development and game development, if we want to finish this project, we need more time to research as well as sharpen our programming skill, we believe that in near future, we will be able to develop a fully functional gaming website.
                <div class="break"></div>
                As we are new to web development as well as game development, we manage to acquire some basic HTML, CSS and JS for our website and using canvas with JS to create the game. About the game, it is all about object-oriented programming, physics and math combination. We have to calculate how the ball react when hit the wall, when it hit the wall as well as the paddle. It was very buggy at the beginning, right now it is less but still not very smooth to play, however, the logic is still fine and playable.
                <div class="break"></div>
                We managed to change our content several times, at first, everybody come up with their own design while learning HTML, CSS, JS by themselves, and then we pick the most voted design and design based on that for whole project page. Coming to the game design, we are using canvas, which is a built-in from HTML and JS, we look up some algorithm to make the ball bouncing as well as hitting different object, moreover, we manage to put up some more features likes sound, point, ending screen, etc.
                <div class="break"></div>
                For the contents, we try to complete all the contents of the report as soon as possible and then move on to the presentation and then we will try to put them all up on our website.

              Several hours were spent deliberating among the members of our team before agreeing on a three-phase scope, with each phase having its own set of objectives and limits. During this first phase, we're primarily concerned with building the framework for the breadth of our many activities. The goal of this phase is to finish all the background work, which includes writing portions of the report and putting together the essential structure for our games. The second phase of our endeavor included developing a version of our game that was oriented toward people. Many things must be done for this to be successful. In the first instance, we could create a platform that would allow individuals to log in using their own accounts. Second, creating a database to store information about the stages the user has completed as well as coins and bonuses earned while playing the game, which includes establishing a technique and creating at least a few game levels. The scope of the project has been expanded in the third phase to include the creation of a working game that may potentially be sold or at the very least used as a proof of concept for a future commercial enterprise. Therefore, substantial polishing, the acquisition of all essential assets, the implementation of all marketing activities, and the completion of the game itself will be required. As soon as the game is released, a "stretch goal" is considered depending on the number of copies sold, and maybe more events, skins, and incentives for players are added to the game's roster.

                Material Design. It comes with a wide range of pre-built parts that can be used right away in production. For Supporting Tools, we use UI Design Tools like Figma (n.d.) and Canva (n.d.). For component prototyping, 
                CodeSandbox (n.d.) is used to help us visualise how our project will look and prototype it.</div>

                        Our website is designed to target RMIT students specifically. Hence, besides testing ourselves, our team also invited 10 RMIT students as test users with different ranges of ages, genders and schools,
                         ensuring the diversity of testing phases.</div>

                        Firstly, our team tested the website to check if the features worked as expected, which were quite successful. Then, we create an online live meeting on Teams with 10 test users as mentioned above. 
                        They will receive the link to TinMate website and have a chance to test its features. After that, we ask for their feedback on their experience with TinMate, whether they are satisfied or not, 
                        what features they like the most and what things should be improved. Due to the familiarity with Tinder’s UI, TinMate receives compliments from test users about the user-friendliness for even low-tech ones
                        and practical features. Currently, Filter Bar and User Profile are the favourite ones as test users can freely set their aims and goals as well as utilise photos and profile descriptions to increase
                        possibility to find matching teammates. They expressed that they were quite interested in the project and were willing to use it if it is officially published. Additionally, we are also grateful for 
                        the constructive comments, which helps us develop tinMate better and deliver a more satisfactory user experience.</div>

                        Because we don't know much about web design, the final product might not work as well or meet quality standards as the prototype. This could mean that planned scope features can't be finished because
                         there isn't enough time or understanding to prepare. To deal with this, our team will meet twice a week to make sure that the projects and members are working steadily and getting good insurance. 
                         The team leader also checks on the member's status and tries to think of all the things that could happen to other members, like missing meetings or quitting. Each member of the team should know what
                          their specific tasks and responsibilities are, and it is recommended that they spend the first few weeks learning the basics of HTML and CSS to help them understand the project and do a better job.                </div>

                        The project's scope could change, and the work might be more than what the team can handle or what was initially planned. Scope creep is most often caused by unauthorised changes or miscommunications 
                        between members, which can lead to poor performance and design systems. Our team decided to avoid this by making a clear project timeline, scope, and out-of-scope to make sure what the project would 
                        include and be able to archive when it was done. We also keep track of the projects' schedules and update the project's scope statement when things change, making sure to find and document any important
                         changes.</div>

                        When we all work together to build the website, it's possible that someone will accidentally delete or mess up some lines of code, which would cause the website to crash without us knowing. 
                        If someone wants to add a new feature to the website, we will use the git checkout branch command to fix the problem. After that, they can ask the team to look over their work by sending a "pull request." 
                        This can make sure the origin master branch is safe.

                        Even though Tinder's user interface and user experience (UI/UX) is used, TinMate only has one goal: to help RMIT students build their professional networks and connect with peers who meet their expectations.
                         There is a chance, though, that some people will use this app for things other than finding teammates or building professional networks. Ellison and Hancock [5] said that one of the main reasons is that
                          traditional signals, like intelligence, skills, characteristics, and so on, are easy to fake online. In the real world, on the other hand, it will be much easier to find out if someone is lying because 
                          they can talk to them or watch them. That goes against what TinMate is trying to do because it will take other users longer and more work to find other ones. To deal with the problem of human error,
                           we will tell other users to report any account that seems to be going against TinMate's goal</div>
                    <li class="general-info">Server overload or attack</li>
                    <div class="info">
                        Since the project will be available to all RMIT students, server bottlenecks will happen often at times like the beginning of a semester or course, when students are using the app to find their teammates.
                         When the app gets popular, someone will try to steal our clients' data or DDOS our server, which could lead to a bad user experience, lost customers, and lower profits. We would set up a more powerful
                          server that can handle a large number of users. We will also make sure our website is always up-to-date and back up our data.</div>

                        We are currently using the out-of-date Material UI v4 open-source React component package, which could cause the website to crash in the future. In other words, if we don't do any more maintenance on our
                         website, the API might not be stable enough to handle Material UI v4, which is now in v5, which could cause the website to load very slowly or even crash. So, even after the project is done, we will keep
                          it up-to-date and take care of it on a regular basis.

                Our team employed numerous various communication channels to fulfill multiple functions throughout member engagement while completing this project.
                <br>
                We utilized Messenger as our main way of live conversation throughout the project's conclusion. Outside of core team meetings, here is where we will communicate individual ideas, such as challenges found during 
                project work or other connected concerns. We also use this strategy to organize future conferences and design possibilities for deciding on a deadline for each objective before agreeing on a precise date. 
                After reviewing the objectives, we assign precise tasks to each member using Trello (Appendix A) software to assist everyone have a better understanding of their activities and keep up with them. Group development. 
                This is the program we discovered to have a significant influence on our job efficiency, and as a result, we fulfill our objectives more thoroughly and with higher quality. We utilize Google tools, such as Drive and
                 Docs, to store and distribute the data uploaded by members (Appendix B). Team members may upload their work and amend reports synchronously here. In terms of group meetings, we will have two weekly core sessions 
                 on Friday and Sunday. On Friday, we will set the objectives for the next week and resolve any outstanding concerns from the previous week. We normally book a group meeting room at the library for this meeting 
                 once a week. In terms of the Sunday meeting, we decided that it would be an online gathering, and we utilized Discord to communicate. This meeting is for everyone to report on the work they have done in the last 
                 week, as well as new ideas and obstacles encountered in the process, so that members may better assist one another. More efficient. Finally, when there is a breakdown in communication within our team, we assign 
                 each team member a distinct assignment and attempt to handle the problem individually. When a problem emerges, the team or a specific member will be contacted promptly to resolve the problem and notify 
                 a colleague who is unable to attend this urgent meeting of the solution.

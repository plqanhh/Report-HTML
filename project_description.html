            A key component of professional growth at universities might be
            regarded to be inter-professional abilities, notably teamwork in
            this study. It operates at the human level via cultural and
            knowledge aspects when it reaches the community level, which means
            that professional viewpoint may cause conflict and moral ambiguity
            about professional duties in project management [1]. In addition,
            challenges might arise from unease, ambiguous job assignment,
            diverse work cultures, and conflicting versions of information [2].
            Therefore, it is advised that students actively seek out teammates
            that meet their expectations when it comes to collaboration. This
            will ensure that the relationships between team members are
            positive, resulting in their willingness to assist, accept, and like
            one another [3].
            <br />
            Group assignments were prioritised in the majority of the courses
            offered ever since RMIT acknowledged the value of teamwork. In
            face-to-face classrooms, on Canvas, or via social media, RMIT
            students may discover teammates both online and offline. However, as
            there isn't yet a platform designed just for RMIT students, their
            messages may not reach the correct people, and it will take a lot of
            effort for them to connect and share information to make sure their
            potential teammates fit their expectations. After identifying the
            insights, our group created TinMate, a website that helps RMIT
            students discover teammates.
          </div>
          <li class="general-info">Topic and Landscape</li>
          <div class="info">
            Since gen Z is using dating apps more and more, especially Tinder
            [4], which is the most popular app in the field, we decided to make
            the UI/UX of the TinMate website similar to Tinder to make it more
            user-friendly and familiar. The site will work like other dating
            apps, but in this prototype, the filter and its criteria will be
            changed to match the site's goal, which is to find teammates. For
            example, the GPA, the goal and strengths of the team, etc., will be
            used as filters. Also, familiar features of dating apps like viewing
            profiles, UI chat boxes, matching, SuperLike, and reporting will
            stay the same. Also, since this site is only for RMIT students, you
            will need to show a screenshot of your student ID card when you sign
            in.
            <br />
            After that, we realised that, even though there are a lot of
            international and exchange students at RMIT, most of the posts about
            finding teammates on social media are in Vietnamese. This makes it
            hard for international students to understand and respond to the
            posts, and it's also a shame for local students because they might
            miss the chance to meet the right teammates. So, (name of website)
            will only use English to make sure everything works together.
            <br />
            It is hoped that the TinMate website will not only fix the problems
            with the old ways, but also give tech-savvy RMIT students a new,
            fun, and easy way to find teammates by using the same UI/UX as
            dating apps. Taking everything into account, our team thinks that
            this site can help RMIT students save time and effort while still
            being able to work with the people they were supposed to work with.

            Even though there are many other methods for the software
            development life cycle, our team decided to use Scrum as our main
            way to work together. This is because we need an agile framework
            that is quick, flexible, and efficient. As a result, Scrum makes it
            easier to build and deliver products during our development phase

            In addition, we decided to use the Trello Management Board to keep
            track of our progress and allocate tasks to each member every week
            (equivalent to every sprint).

            The list of prioritised work is given to each teammate after weekly
            meetings. The most important tasks are put at the top of the backlog
            so the development and designing team knows what to work on first.
            If issues arise or improvements are made, the Scrum Master - An -
            regularly reviews, updates, and reorders tasks

              Weekly Meeting
            </ol>
            Weekly meetings are often held on Sunday so that all team members
            have time to discuss. We go over what we have done, what we are
            doing and what we are going to do. Additionally, team members
            highlight the challenges they are facing so that everyone can debate
            them and find solutions. Finally, we often kept track of our
            progress throughout the week by recording in the Meeting Minutes.

              Project background story
            </ol>
            During our Initiation Phase, we had a team meeting to think about
            what kind of project that we should develop. We were aiming for
            something innovative and unique. Additionally, the project should
            also have the objective of helping RMIT students. It took us a while
            for us to finally come up with something like a Tinder-clone but
            with an educational intention, which is searching for teammates. If
            you don’t know about Tinder, basically it’s a dating social network
            where you can see the details (or biography) of other people such as
            their interests, occupations, ages, etc. As we all had used Tinder
            before, we had no trouble imagining how our project would work.
            <div class="break"></div>
            Moving on to the Planning and Estimation Phase, we had another
            meeting to decide what tools that we should use and tasks allocation
            for each member. We agreed that we would use GitHub as our version
            control system and code hosting platform. About the Technologies, at
            first, we decided to only make the user interface for our
            tinder-clone website with the use of HTML and CSS. However, upon
            some discussions, we then decided to use the basic ReactJS and take
            advantage of the ‘tinder-card-swipe’ module in the NPM package with
            CSS and in-line CSS.
            <div class="break"></div>
            The final obstacle that we face is with the deployment of the
            website, as we also aim for the interactive and responsive design,
            we choose Netlify for our deployment platform. However, it was very
            difficult and prone-to-error due to the number of bugs that we
            encountered and our lack of knowledge for Javascript. At the end,
            thanks to our persistence, we overcame all difficulties and
            finalised our web app. With that being said, as we often finished
            our allocated tasks early, we decided to go overboard and turn our
            website into a web app.

          Due to the responsiveness of our system and interactive features, we
          decided to use the JavaScript framework, ReactJS (n.d.) with Material
          UI (n.d.) - an open-source React component package that uses Google's
          Material Design. It comes with a wide range of pre-built parts that
          can be used right away in production. For Supporting Tools, we use UI
          Design Tools like Figma (n.d.) and Canva (n.d.). For component
          prototyping, CodeSandbox (n.d.) is used to help us visualise how our
          project will look and prototype it.

              Our website is designed to target RMIT students specifically.
              Hence, besides testing ourselves, our team also invited 10 RMIT
              students as test users with different ranges of ages, genders and
              schools, ensuring the diversity of testing phases.

            <div class="info">
              Firstly, our team tested the website to check if the features
              worked as expected, which were quite successful. Then, we create
              an online live meeting on Teams with 10 test users as mentioned
              above. They will receive the link to TinMate website and have a
              chance to test its features. After that, we ask for their feedback
              on their experience with TinMate, whether they are satisfied or
              not, what features they like the most and what things should be
              improved. Due to the familiarity with Tinder’s UI, TinMate
              receives compliments from test users about the user-friendliness
              for even low-tech ones and practical features. Currently, Filter
              Bar and User Profile are the favourite ones as test users can
              freely set their aims and goals as well as utilise photos and
              profile descriptions to increase possibility to find matching
              teammates. They expressed that they were quite interested in the
              project and were willing to use it if it is officially published.
              Additionally, we are also grateful for the constructive comments,
              which helps us develop tinMate better and deliver a more
              satisfactory user experience.

                Because we don't know much about web design, the final product
                might not work as well or meet quality standards as the
                prototype. This could mean that planned scope features can't be
                finished because there isn't enough time or understanding to
                prepare. To deal with this, our team will meet twice a week to
                make sure that the projects and members are working steadily and
                getting good insurance. The team leader also checks on the
                member's status and tries to think of all the things that could
                happen to other members, like missing meetings or quitting. Each
                member of the team should know what their specific tasks and
                responsibilities are, and it is recommended that they spend the
                first few weeks learning the basics of HTML and CSS to help them
                understand the project and do a better job.

                The project's scope could change, and the work might be more

                Scope creep is most often caused by unauthorised changes or
                miscommunications between members, which can lead to poor
                performance and design systems. Our team decided to avoid this
                by making a clear project timeline, scope, and out-of-scope to
                make sure what the project would include and be able to archive
                when it was done. We also keep track of the projects' schedules
                and update the project's scope statement when things change,
                making sure to find and document any important changes.

                code, which would cause the website to crash without us knowing.
                If someone wants to add a new feature to the website, we will
                use the git checkout branch command to fix the problem. After
                that, they can ask the team to look over their work by sending a
                "pull request." This can make sure the origin master branch is
                safe.

                Even though Tinder's user interface and user experience (UI/UX)
                is used, TinMate only has one goal: to help RMIT students build
                their professional networks and connect with peers who meet
                their expectations. There is a chance, though, that some people
                will use this app for things other than finding teammates or
                building professional networks. Ellison and Hancock [5] said
                that one of the main reasons is that traditional signals, like
                intelligence, skills, characteristics, and so on, are easy to
                fake online. In the real world, on the other hand, it will be
                much easier to find out if someone is lying because they can
                talk to them or watch them. That goes against what TinMate is
                trying to do because it will take other users longer and more
                work to find other ones. To deal with the problem of human
                error, we will tell other users to report any account that seems
                to be going against TinMate's goal

                Since the project will be available to all RMIT students, server
                bottlenecks will happen often at times like the beginning of a
                semester or course, when students are using the app to find
                their teammates. When the app gets popular, someone will try to
                steal our clients' data or DDOS our server, which could lead to
                a bad user experience, lost customers, and lower profits. We
                would set up a more powerful server that can handle a large
                number of users. We will also make sure our website is always
                up-to-date and back up our data.

                We are currently using the out-of-date Material UI v4

          Our team employed numerous various communication channels to fulfill
          multiple functions throughout member engagement while completing this

          <br />
          We utilized Messenger as our main way of live conversation throughout
          the project's conclusion. Outside of core team meetings, here is where
          we will communicate individual ideas, such as challenges found during
          project work or other connected concerns. We also use this strategy to
          organize future conferences and design possibilities for deciding on a
          deadline for each objective before agreeing on a precise date. After
          reviewing the objectives, we assign precise tasks to each member using
          Trello (Appendix A) software to assist everyone have a better
          understanding of their activities and keep up with them. Group
          development. This is the program we discovered to have a significant
          influence on our job efficiency, and as a result, we fulfill our
          objectives more thoroughly and with higher quality. We utilize Google
          tools, such as Drive and Docs, to store and distribute the data
          uploaded by members (Appendix B). Team members may upload their work
          and amend reports synchronously here. In terms of group meetings, we
          will have two weekly core sessions on Friday and Sunday. On Friday, we
          will set the objectives for the next week and resolve any outstanding
          concerns from the previous week. We normally book a group meeting room
          at the library for this meeting once a week. In terms of the Sunday
          meeting, we decided that it would be an online gathering, and we
          utilized Discord to communicate. This meeting is for everyone to
          report on the work they have done in the last week, as well as new
          ideas and obstacles encountered in the process, so that members may
          better assist one another. More efficient. Finally, when there is a
          breakdown in communication within our team, we assign each team member
          a distinct assignment and attempt to handle the problem individually.
          When a problem emerges, the team or a specific member will be
          contacted promptly to resolve the problem and notify a colleague who
          is unable to attend this urgent meeting of the solution.

                After completing this TeamMate project, I gained more knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is new knowledge I have never learned. Still, after working with friends in the working group, I have learned a lot from the expertise in new programming languages, how to organize folder layout, how to use GitHub, and how to report your work. In addition, I also received a lot of help from people on making reports and comments so that the finished product would have the best effect. This is also a product that I am very passionate about, and I also spend a lot of time revising, updating, and completing it. I hope this product will be well received by everyone and can share the bugs or parts people don't like so we can fix and improve. If successful, I also want to popularize this application widely in RMIT and other schools to help students have an effective and safe teamwork environment.

                In this project, our group has worked so well together. Everyone takes their responsibility seriously, and is willing to support each other if there is any issue. Although we have a lot of meetings, we try to maintain a fun atmosphere. That helps our team to be more comfortable to share our thoughts and communicate more effectively. However, at the first period of time, we became too chilled, and it turned out that we wasted lots of time without any result. After that, to solve that problem, we always have an agenda for each meeting to ensure the progress and its quality.
                Moreover, I have learned many new things while working on this project. Since I am completely new to IT classes, I have so many challenges to adapt with the new things. My supportive teammates helped me a lot, e.g. explaining about technical phrases and sending useful online tutorials for me to study myself. Also, I have developed a general understanding about the technology industry in general and information systems in particular. Besides, one thing surprises me is that I never thought that I could study lots of interesting and completely new knowledge from a different major in just one semester. That motivates me to keep working hard to achieve my goals - becoming a software quality assurance in the future.

                    After many discussions, we came up with the final team name: TinMate due to many reasons. Firstly, since our project is inspired by Tinder, 
                    we want to give our project a name that has similarities with that dating app.

                    Secondly, the name has a specific meaning, representing our team essence. Before working as a team, we did not know each other, and each member 
                    has different schools, majors, years of study and ages. We understand that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and the weakness of 
                    an individual can be the strength of someone else in the group. Hence, by communicating effectively about our abilities, we are able to allocate 
                    tasks to suit everyone, allowing each person to contribute their best to the projects. By that, we build trust in each other, which helps us to deliver 
                    the best result on this project.

                        My name is Do Le Long An, but as I have gone by Tony for the past two years while I have been studying abroad in Australia, I would want to go by that 
                        name. When it comes to IT, I have a lot to talk about since I have had ups and downs during my learning period. In terms of our chosen topic, having 
                        studied abroad in Australia for two years, I felt very isolated when I came back to Vietnam and enrolled in RMIT Vietnam. Using my experiences in 
                        Australia, I got lucky in finding teams. However, I still find the process of finding suitable teammates time - consuming and exhausting, especially if 
                        you do not know anyone. Moreover, being a competent person, I would prefer taking initiative in looking for a group project than getting randomly assigned 
                        by the tutor. As a result, when my teammates proposed this project idea, I got along with it immediately. Speaking from my perspective, I want to help my 
                        friends as well as RMIT students to have better teammates, who share the goal and vision with them. Moreover, I hope that our website can enrich the 
                        networking culture in RMIT by connecting more like - minded people.

                        I am enrolled in my first year, and according to the Automation Engineering department at my previous university, I have some experience with Python, C++, 
                        JavaScript, and PLC. I've had experience working on several projects, including embedded programming. While studying IT at RMIT, I minored in artificial 
                        intelligence. I find Python to be really fascinating. I'll improve this semester by using HTML and CSS to support our team project. I'll also think about 
                        brainstorming and sharing ideas with my teammate because I value the development of various creative abilities that can be applied to tasks. As a Front-End 
                        developer and Development Supervisor, I am capable of doing my job. I can also supervise our project's user-friendly interface and develop a user-friendly one. 
                        Additionally, by assisting coworkers with their tasks, I can learn what skills I lack from them and set myself to better fill my role on the team.

                        My name is Quynh Anh, although most people call me Kelly. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, and I am currently enrolled in my fourth semester at RMIT 
                        and first semester of Information Technology. As a former student of Software Engineering, I have experience with C, C++, Java, and SQL. At my high school in Boston,
                        Massachusetts, I have encountered a variety of individuals with distinct characteristics. I learn a great deal from them, particularly how to cultivate an interest 
                        in programming. Seeing all the wonderful applications that can do astonished and motivated me to seek a career in technology. When I ran the code for "Hello World!" 
                        for the first time after learning Python in high school on freecodecamp, I felt like I had the world in the palm of my hand. In addition to learning how to apply 
                        Figma and design UI/UX, the course teaches me HTML and CSS, which I study on YouTube in my own time so that I may contribute to the development of our project. 
                        I will collaborate with other people to effectively build the project by exchanging and generating ideas.

                        new people or establish acquaintances. After attending university, I tried to change myself by joining RMIT Student Ambassador Team and RMIT Taekwondo Club. Now, I am capable 
                        of establishing and maintaining discussions with classmates as well as enjoying the joy of making friends. This encourages me to return and assist other peers who are eager to 
                        make friends at school. Through the website, we seek to provide RMIT students more opportunity to develop their networks and make connections with others who have similar interests and academic goals.

                    Our group has worked quite well together due to effective project management. Firstly, task allocation is decided based on individual strengths. Tony is in charge of managing and keeping

                    with support from Quynh Anh and Tony. Finally, Phuoc will double-check if the website works as expected.To keep track of the project’s flow, our team has a weekly meeting on Friday. 
                    In the meeting, each member will update about the progress and difficulties if having. By doing that, the team can support and find the solution for problems as soon as possible. 
                    Meeting agenda and meeting minutes will be recorded by Quynh Anh, and then uploaded on Trello and Google Drive for other team members to view later.

                    With a passion for technology since middle school, I was very interested in learning and using new technology products such as smartwatches and innovative home systems controlled via 
                    controllers—Google Alexa hub. And I also got to visit technology companies like 3M and Bosch, which motivated me to become an AI engineer to make life more meaningful in the future. 
                    Shortly, I also wanted to apply the Machine Learning I learned to our current project, TeamMate, making it run more intelligently and meet our users' complex needs. In the future,
                    I will try to improve my knowledge of algorithms used in AI, like Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Logistic Regression, and Clustering Algorithms which will be the foundation for me 
                    to find the right job for my passion. The current development of AI technology is helping our lives in areas such as health and education and can make life more secure. I also want to 
                    contribute to this development while pursuing my passion and developing technologies that are useful to society and everyone.

                    Although my major is digital marketing, I have been interested in the technology industry for a long time. Hence, since I have a business-related background of knowledge, I want to find a 
                    career that can hamonize between my strengths and my weaknesses - which is the shortage of technical knowledge to compete with others. After researching, I figured out that being a Software 
                    Quality Assurance may suit me as I have learned about customer journey and psychology in digital marketing courses, which can help me to understand the behaviour of end users better to test 
                    softwares. Recently, I have attended many online courses to learn about software testing and also some basic technical courses to be able to view the industry in a better understanding. 
                    In the future, I will try to improve my knowledge in testing and may take an internship to apply what I have learned into practice.

                    With a confused plan and unmotivated self until the third semester at RMIT, I feel like this industry is not for me, struggling to learn, to motivate myself, to understand the concept, 
                    dealing with depression and anxiety, and keeping things to myself. I honestly do not know if this is my right choice , with the peer pressure and finance problems.Fortunately, 
                    I met my tutor, who guided me through all the up and downs that motivated me to work as hard as her and think about who I will be in 10 years and how can I become that person. 
                    As for the plan, I will be looking for an internship in my sophomore year in any small company, or start-up to gain the experience, then take extra courses outside of school to enhance 
                    my knowledge. At the moment, I am interested in Front-end development so I need to learn JavaScript, and mỏe framework to work on mobile development and web development. 
                    I intend to exchange to Melbourne in my junior year for more opportunities and experiences to work on more projects that enhance my practical skill. I do not have a dream company at the 
                    moment but I think I am going to get into any big tech company, perhaps in a different country.

                    I have always had a passion for designing for a long time. In other words, I often feel motivated whenever I am able to build something for myself. As a result, when it comes to coding, 
                    I soon found the enthusiasm of learning it when I first built a game project for the first time. However, I then gradually lost interest in Computer Science during my time in Australia. 
                    Looking back, things would have been different if I hadn't chosen Data Analyst major, which is reputed for being well-paid. As a result, because of COVID, I was relieved that I could return 
                    to Vietnam and start a new career path in RMIT Vietnam, which is Web Development. With the growth of Web 3.0, the websites and web apps are getting more and more interactive, responsive with 
                    3D animations, which inspires me a lot in becoming a Web Developer. Thus, I am self-learning many JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, Angular, Vue, Three.js etc. so that 
                    I could become a Fullstack developer one day. Currently I am focusing on improving my ReactJS as frontend developer and, Java and MySQL for backend development.

                    After many discussions, we came up with the final team name: TinMate due to many reasons. Firstly, since our project is inspired by Tinder, 
                    we want to give our project a name that has similarities with that dating app.

                    Secondly, the name has a specific meaning, representing our team essence. Before working as a team, we did not know each other, and each member 
                    has different schools, majors, years of study and ages. We understand that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and the weakness of 
                    an individual can be the strength of someone else in the group. Hence, by communicating effectively about our abilities, we are able to allocate 
                    tasks to suit everyone, allowing each person to contribute their best to the projects. By that, we build trust in each other, which helps us to deliver 
                    the best result on this project.

                        My name is Do Le Long An, but as I have gone by Tony for the past two years while I have been studying abroad in Australia, I would want to go by that 
                        name. When it comes to IT, I have a lot to talk about since I have had ups and downs during my learning period. In terms of our chosen topic, having 
                        studied abroad in Australia for two years, I felt very isolated when I came back to Vietnam and enrolled in RMIT Vietnam. Using my experiences in 
                        Australia, I got lucky in finding teams. However, I still find the process of finding suitable teammates time - consuming and exhausting, especially if 
                        you do not know anyone. Moreover, being a competent person, I would prefer taking initiative in looking for a group project than getting randomly assigned 
                        by the tutor. As a result, when my teammates proposed this project idea, I got along with it immediately. Speaking from my perspective, I want to help my 
                        friends as well as RMIT students to have better teammates, who share the goal and vision with them. Moreover, I hope that our website can enrich the 
                        networking culture in RMIT by connecting more like - minded people.

                        I am enrolled in my first year, and according to the Automation Engineering department at my previous university, I have some experience with Python, C++, 
                        JavaScript, and PLC. I've had experience working on several projects, including embedded programming. While studying IT at RMIT, I minored in artificial 
                        intelligence. I find Python to be really fascinating. I'll improve this semester by using HTML and CSS to support our team project. I'll also think about 
                        brainstorming and sharing ideas with my teammate because I value the development of various creative abilities that can be applied to tasks. As a Front-End 
                        developer and Development Supervisor, I am capable of doing my job. I can also supervise our project's user-friendly interface and develop a user-friendly one. 
                        Additionally, by assisting coworkers with their tasks, I can learn what skills I lack from them and set myself to better fill my role on the team.

                        My name is Quynh Anh, although most people call me Kelly. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, and I am currently enrolled in my fourth semester at RMIT 
                        and first semester of Information Technology. As a former student of Software Engineering, I have experience with C, C++, Java, and SQL. At my high school in Boston,
                        Massachusetts, I have encountered a variety of individuals with distinct characteristics. I learn a great deal from them, particularly how to cultivate an interest 
                        in programming. Seeing all the wonderful applications that can do astonished and motivated me to seek a career in technology. When I ran the code for "Hello World!" 
                        for the first time after learning Python in high school on freecodecamp, I felt like I had the world in the palm of my hand. In addition to learning how to apply 
                        Figma and design UI/UX, the course teaches me HTML and CSS, which I study on YouTube in my own time so that I may contribute to the development of our project. 
                        I will collaborate with other people to effectively build the project by exchanging and generating ideas.

                        My name is My Phuoc, from TinMate Team, and my student ID is s3836234. I am currently a senior student at RMIT University. I used to be too timid and reserved to approach 
                        new people or establish acquaintances. After attending university, I tried to change myself by joining RMIT Student Ambassador Team and RMIT Taekwondo Club. Now, I am capable 
                        of establishing and maintaining discussions with classmates as well as enjoying the joy of making friends. This encourages me to return and assist other peers who are eager to 
                        make friends at school. Through the website, we seek to provide RMIT students more opportunity to develop their networks and make connections with others who have similar interests and academic goals.
